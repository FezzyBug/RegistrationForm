      The below pattern is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5

TODO -> ***************** Understanding the form element and it's attributes *****************
Reference for further reading: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp

The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute.

The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST

request as data in the request body (with method="post").

TODO -> ****************** For Further information on Password Field **************

Refer to: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password

minlength="8"

- minlength

The minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the password entry field.
This must be a non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength.
If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the password input has no minimum length.

- pattern

Refer to: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_pattern.asp

The pattern attribute specifies a regular expression that the <input> element's value is checked against on form submission.

Note: The pattern attribute works with the following input types: text, date, search, url, tel, email, and password.

An <input> element with type="password" that must contain 8 or more characters:
                                               ↓ ↓
<input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd" pattern=".{8,}" title="Eight or more characters">


TODO -> ******************* Accessibility Best Practices *************************

Follow accessibility best practices by linking the input elements and the label elements in the second fieldset.

So this would mean linking the label with a "for" value that is the same as the "id" value as the input

TODO -> ******************** Hyperlinking Text and Creating Images in forms ************************

- use <a href="YOUR LINK"></a> wrapped around whatever text you want to hyperlink

- use  <input type="file"></label> to add an image input
